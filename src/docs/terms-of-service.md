Introduction
------------

1.  KubeBuild is a software development build automation suite. KubeBuild is proudly Australian owned and developed. These Terms of Service are prepared in accordance with Australian laws, but KubeBuild can be used by anyone, anywhere. In general, KubeBuild wants to have as many happy Customers as possible. KubeBuild would be foolish to change pricing, features or services in a way that made Customer's unhappy. However, as a SaaS product, KubeBuild will change over time (presumably for the better).
2.  In these Terms of Service, the "Important Terms" mostly deal using KubeBuild, and the "General Conditions" set out the legal basis on which KubeBuild is provided. You must accept these terms to use KubeBuild.
3.  KubeBuild treats the confidentiality of our Customer's information seriously, and handles all personal information in accordance with Australian privacy laws. Simply, we protect our Customers' information, not exploit it.
